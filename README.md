What is SDLC?
In software testing, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is about making sure that the software works well and is free of bugs during every step of development.
SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process

Example:
Imagine you’re building a house. While you plan, design, and build it, you also keep checking to make sure everything is strong and safe. Similarly, in SDLC, testing happens at different stages to ensure that the software meets the requirements and works as expected.




SDLC stages:

1.Planning: Testers work with the team to understand what the software is supposed to do.
2.Requirements / Defining: Testers help check that the requirements are clear and testable.
3.Design: Testers plan how they will test the software, deciding what tools and methods to use.
4.Development / Building: While the developers write the code, testers may do small checks to catch problems early.
5.Testing: Once the software is built, testers perform detailed checks (like running test cases) to find bugs or problems.
6.Deployment: Testers make sure the software works in the real-world environment before it’s given to users.
